                    <p>In my spare time I love to play video games. I have played almost every console there is and I love each of them.
                        I am a big fan of the zelda series and have been playing it since the N64 days. Another series I have been playing for awhile now is COD.
                        I have been playing ever since COD4 and I have enjoyed it very much. I find myself playing the new Modern Warfare quite often when 
                        I get a chance to. 
                    </p>

                    <h4>Bowling</h4>
                    <img src="../assets/images/bowlingAlley.jpg" alt="Orofino Bowling Alley" width="500" height="300"class="responsive">
                    <p>Another thing I have come to love over the years is bowling. I don't bowl that often, but when I do it is very enjoyable.
                        I loved it so much that I ended up getting a custom bowling ball which my fingers fit into perfectly. My highest score ever was 215 when I was bowling daily.
                        Nowadays I bowl anywhere from 130-180, it just depends on the day. I would love to get more involved like I used to, but I just don't have the time these days.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Coding!</h4>
                    <img src="../assets/images/coding.jpg" alt="coding image" class="responsive" id = "codingImage">
                    <p>This one should be obvious. Why else would I be going to school for this if I didn't enjoy it? 
                        I like to experiment around and learn new things. I am constantly gaining coding knowledge and it makes me excited for what the future may hold.
                        I have progressed alot over the last few years and I am expecting to improve even more.
